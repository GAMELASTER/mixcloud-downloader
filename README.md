mixcloud-downloader
===================

a simple php script to find donwload links for the original (uncompressed) content using a mixcloud link. made for those of us out there that can't bear to listen to 64kbit m4a. this is not intended to be used for batch downloading, and i only made it due to the pain i endure listening to their compressed content.
