mixcloud-downloader
===================

A simple php script to find download links for the original (uncompressed) content using a mixcloud link. Made for those of us out there that can't bear to listen to 64kbit m4a. This is not intended to be used for batch downloading, and I only made it due to the pain I endure listening to their compressed content.
